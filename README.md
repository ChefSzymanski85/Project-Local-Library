# Project Local Library
First project in Thinkful course. Used fake Library data containing arrays of accounts, books, and authors. Created functions 
to pull all types of different data from a local library.

## Features
Contains a dashboard that shows which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

## Technology
- Higher-order functions
- Desctructuring
- Helper functions
- Ternerary operator
- Spread operator
- Object shorthand

## Discoveries
Learned how to access and pull data from nested arrays and objects.

## Future Goals
Allow the app to fetch an API to a real library and edit the functions to work with that data.
